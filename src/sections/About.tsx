          Hello! I'm Krish, a passionate developer with a love for creating
          beautiful and functional web applications. With a strong background in
          JavaScript and React, I enjoy building user-friendly interfaces and
          exploring new technologies. In my free time, I like to contribute to
          open-source projects and learn about the latest trends in web
          development.

          I have worked in various full-stack projects, mobile applications,
          games, bot and automation scripts, and even hardware projects like
